# Aelpher 2.0 Philosophy

## Core Tenets

### 1. NOT a Task Manager
Aelpher is an **operational instrument panel**, not a todo list. It exists to provide situational awareness across two parallel strategic commitments.

### 2. Local-First
The operator's machine is the source of truth. Cloud sync is a backup mechanism, not a dependency.

### 3. Strict Arm Isolation
IBM and CS are separate universes. No data flows between them. No combined views. No comparative metrics (except energy allocation).

### 4. Evidence Over Feelings
Reflections capture objective evidence only. They have zero scoring impact. They exist for future audit, not present optimization.

### 5. Machine Calculates, Operator Decides
The NBA scoring engine provides recommendations. The operator retains full override authority with the manual lock mechanism.

## Design Language

- **Monospace fonts**: Precision over aesthetics
- **Status colors**: Semantic meaning (green/yellow/gray/red)
- **Full outlines**: Clear boundaries, no ambiguity
- **High density**: Maximum information per pixel
- **Military time**: Unambiguous timestamps

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Gamification (points, streaks, badges)
❌ Social features (sharing, collaboration)
❌ Notifications (the operator checks when ready)
❌ Mobile support (requires focus environment)
❌ AI assistance (the operator is the intelligence)
