# Aelpher 2.0 Operational Rules

## Logging Rules

1. Log every significant action (> 15 min effort)
2. Use action verbs: "Completed", "Reviewed", "Submitted", "Blocked"
3. Include duration when known
4. Blockers must include "blocked" in action or details

## NBA Rules

1. Every theater should have at least 3 NBAs queued
2. Manually locked NBAs persist until unlocked
3. Switch to AUTO mode to let the scoring engine decide
4. Update NBA descriptions when scope changes

## Reflection Rules

1. Evidence only — no opinions, no plans
2. Context is optional but recommended
3. No scoring impact — reflections are for audit
4. Maximum 50 reflections retained per theater

## Status Interpretation

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ACTIVE | Healthy engagement | Continue |
| WARM | Recent but not current | Return soon |
| IDLE | Needs attention | Prioritize |
| BLOCKED | Critical | Resolve blocker |

## Energy Allocation

- Total always equals 100%
- Imbalance > 60% triggers overload warning
- Adjust based on current priorities

## Overload Risk Factors

1. Stale items (> 5 days)
2. Blocked status on either theater
3. Idle status on either theater
4. Energy imbalance
